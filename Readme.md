**Face Identification:** Spotting a human face in an image <br>
**Face Recognition:** Determining which individual the face belongs to. 

In this project: we use the image recognition functionality in the 'face-recognition' python library

**Steps:** <br>
1) Capture the face encodings of Known images. <br>
2) Capture the face encodings of the Unknown images <br>
3) Compare the two and check whether the known image encodings are similar to those of images with unknown faces.
